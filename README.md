# Protocol-Switching-using-DaaS

Dialogue protocols define how a dialogue may proceed and the moves its participants can make within it. Over the course of a dialogue the participantsâ€™ goals and strategies may change in response to the other participants within the dialogue. Enabling agents to switch between protocols gives them the flexibility to address these changes and make use of them. Dialogue as a Service (DaaS), a platform for building multi-agent dialogue systems can be used to create a wide range of multi-agent dialogue systems. DaaS can be used to facilitate and manage both licit and illicit protocol switches as demonstrated in this paper "Protocol Switching in a Multi-Agent Dialogue System".
